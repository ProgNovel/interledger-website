    answer_html: >-
      <p>The Interledger Foundation is a non-profit advocate for the Interledger
      Protocol and the open web. We promote innovation, creativity and inclusion
      by advancing open payment standards and technologies that can seamlessly
      connect our global society. To drive our<strong> </strong>vision forward,

      </strong>support<strong> </strong>creative and innovative solutions to

  - question: >-
      Why are you forming and launching operations as the Interledger
      Foundation?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>We are launching the Interledger Foundation because we believe that
      everyone in the world should be able to participate in the digital
      economy. This requires the ability to transfer money without any barriers
      or friction and to monetize content on the web, both of which are features
      that the Interledger Protocol provides. In addition, a key piece in
      ensuring frictionless payments and the movement of money between borders
      involves establishing a set of standards that all participants in the
      ecosystem can agree upon. The Interledger Foundation drives the
      Interledger Protocol community toward engagement in establishing these
      imperative global standards and will be the home where the standards live,
      once fully realized.</p>

      payments on the web.</li><li>Drive Web Monetization Innovation: The

  - question: What is the Web Monetization Challenge for Creators Today?
    answer_html: >-
      <p><strong>The Web Monetization Problem:</strong></p><p>Predatory revenue
      models like programmatic advertising and data tracking, combined with the
      high cost of data to serve mobile ads, prevent millions from participating
      in digital creator economies. Using an open payments network in which
      anyone can seamlessly earn, buy, sell, trade and share, the Interledger
      Foundation will build equitable pathways to financial access and digital
      participation.</p><p><strong>The Solution:</strong></p><p><a
      href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization</a> is being proposed
      as a W3C standard. Using the Interledger Protocol, the Web Monetization
      proposed standard aims to make it easier for web creators to generate
      income from their work without relying on advertising, site-by-site
      subscriptions or tracking models. This is especially relevant in
      developing economies where more content and consumers are moving
      online.</p><p><strong>Advancing the Ecosystem: Grant for the Web
      </strong></p><p>Aided by the Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s <a
      href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for the Web</a> program,
      innovations in Web Monetization are opening up an entire financial
      ecosystem for everyone from app and game developers, to artists, musicians
      and podcasters, to journalists and freelancers.</p><p>For example, the
      Grant for the Web will fund individuals, projects and global communities
      that contribute to a privacy-centric, open and accessible Web Monetization
      ecosystem. It will prioritize innovative ideas that incorporate or build
      upon the Web Monetization proposed standard and protocols. Funds will
      support projects, content, experimentation and learning around natively
      integrating monetization into the web using open protocols and
      standards.</p><p>As new content, video or gaming platforms are created on
      the web, they create ways to financially support their artists. For
      example, creators, like Grant for the Web Media media artist <a
      href="http://annieberman.net/">Annie Berman</a>, Director of<a
      href="http://www.the-faithful.com"> </a><a
      href="http://www.the-faithful.com">The Faithful</a>,<a
      href="http://annieberman.net/"> </a>are using the web monetized video
      platform <a
      href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/cinnamon--spicing-up-video-creation-sharing-and-monetizing/">Cinnamon</a>
      to stage films worldwide, enabling ticket holders to get access to special
      bonus events and monetize viewing revenue in terms of hours watched. The
      <a
      href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/reimaging-how-we-pay-for-content-and-apps/">Puma
      Browser</a>, the first browser to natively support the Web Monetization
      proposed standard using Interledger, enables direct value transfer between
      content and game creators and their fans, creating a great alternative to
      ads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
