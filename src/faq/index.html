  - question: What is the Interledger Foundation’s Mission?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>The Interledger Foundation is a non-profit advocate for the Interledger
      Protocol and the open web. We promote innovation, creativity and inclusion
      by advancing open payment standards and technologies that can seamlessly
      connect our global society. To drive our<strong> </strong>vision forward,

      </strong>support<strong> </strong>creative and innovative solutions to

  - question: >-
      Why are you forming and launching operations as the Interledger
      Foundation?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>We are launching the Interledger Foundation because we believe that
      everyone in the world should be able to participate in the digital
      economy. This requires the ability to transfer money without any barriers
      or friction and to monetize content on the web, both of which are features
      that the Interledger Protocol provides. In addition, a key piece in
      ensuring frictionless payments and the movement of money between borders
      involves establishing a set of standards that all participants in the
      ecosystem can agree upon. The Interledger Foundation drives the
      Interledger Protocol community toward engagement in establishing these
      imperative global standards and will be the home where the standards live,
      once fully realized.</p>
