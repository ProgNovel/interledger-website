**San Francisco, Calif.** —**&nbsp;April 14, 2021**&nbsp;—The[Interledger Foundation](https://interledger.org/) today announced that it has formally launched operations as a charitable nonprofit organization. The Foundation’s mission is to steward and advocate for Interledger, an open protocol that permits frictionless payments and micropayments across currencies and ledgers, resulting in opportunities for broader global financial inclusion. Although the creators of the internet knew that it was important to incorporate digital payments natively into its infrastructure, a web-native payments feature is still “[reserved for future use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)” according to its 402 error code. As a result, the gap has been filled over the last 30 years with closed, fee-based and siloed payment networks, which have helped accelerate the financial exclusion of the world's 1.7 billion unbanked people. Simultaneously, predatory revenue models such as programmatic advertising and data tracking, combined with the high cost of serving mobile ads, prevent millions from participating in digital creator economies. By using an open payments network in which anyone can seamlessly earn, buy, sell, trade and share, the Interledger Foundation will build equitable pathways to financial access and digital participation.

Through funding from its founding members Coil and Ripple and its [Board of Directors](https://interledger.org/about-us#board), the Foundation will advance and support the Interledger Protocol and its open source community in developing better technological standards and new business models for the unbanked and creative economy. The Foundation is now the permanent home of the [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/) program, which funds individuals, projects and global communities contributing to an open and accessible web monetization ecosystem. Coil, Creative Commons and the Mozilla Foundation will continue to provide governance for Grant for the Web.

"The Interledger Foundation aims to bring global awareness to this amazing technology," said Interledger Foundation Executive Director Briana Marbury. "And the potential impact would be life-changing for one-third of the world’s population. By fostering the interoperability of formerly siloed networks and providing alternatives to traditional earning models on the web, the Interledger Protocol has the power to greatly advance financial inclusion and uplift the lives of billions in the process."&nbsp;

**Interledger: Driving Global Financial Inclusion**<br>One of the most compelling open payments use cases of the Interledger Protocol has been [Mojaloop](https://interledger.org/case-studies/making-digital-payments-affordable-and-simple-for-everyone-everywhere/). The open source software makes it easier for nations to design open payments systems that loop in the unbanked — making it easy to transfer money through a simple SMS text message. Interledger helps make it possible for Mojaloop’s interoperability layer to connect all users, bank accounts, mobile money wallets and merchants in one open payments loop. By removing the barriers that have hindered open payments models, Interledger and Mojaloop enable the world to better meet the digital financial needs of the 1.7 billion unbanked.

Innovation is already taking place in sub-Saharan Africa, where early Mojaloop adopters include a central bank as well as a joint venture between Mobile Network Operators. According to the [McKinsey Global Institute](https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https:%2F%2Fwww.mckinsey.com%2F~%2Fmedia%2FMcKinsey%2FFeatured%2520Insights%2FEmployment%2520and%2520Growth%2FHow%2520digital%2520finance%2520could%2520boost%2520growth%2520in%2520emerging%2520economies%2FMGI-Digital-Finance-For-All-Executive-summary-September-2016.ashx&amp;data=02%7C01%7CAmy.Enright%40gatesfoundation.org%7C7c96b78e14914c1334fa08d7e8a85e47%7C296b38384bd5496cbd4bf456ea743b74%7C0%7C0%7C637233682142813128&amp;sdata=Q1oP2MLVQwGZ%2Fbhp9t%2FKr%2FPftwWdbGsgQYVtozllazY%3D&amp;reserved=0), wider adoption of interoperable, open payments could provide more of the population with access to important digital financial services, while boosting the annual GDP of all emerging economies by $3.7 trillion by 2025.&nbsp;

“We need a frictionless way for everybody on the web to compensate and support one another: the curators, the subscription services, the content creators and, of course, the users. The Interledger Protocol is the underlying technology that will be the catalyst in bringing this to fruition," said Interledger Foundation Chairperson Stefan Thomas, Founder and CEO of [Coil](https://interledger.org/case-studies/coil/), and Co-Creator of the Interledger Protocol.&nbsp;

**Advancing the Web’s Creative Economy to All**<br>Aided by the Interledger Foundation’s [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/) program, innovations in [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/), a proposed World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard, are opening up an entire financial ecosystem for everyone from app and game developers, artists, musicians and podcasters to journalists and freelancers. Using the Interledger Protocol, the Web Monetization browser API provides an open, native, efficient and automatic way to compensate creators that does not force them to rely on advertising, site-by-site subscriptions, or tracking models. This is especially relevant in developing economies where more content creators and consumers are moving online.&nbsp;

“Interledger has the power to disrupt and equalize current online payment structures to expand financial access and help monetize the work of millions of creators on the web. An interconnected payment system based on open standards can provide a viable alternative to siloed systems, walled gardens, and ad and subscription models. By making low-cost transfers of money as easy and inexpensive to send over the internet as it is to send data, Interledger enables a more open global digital economy,” said Interledger Foundation President Evan Schwartz, Co-Creator of the Interledger Protocol.&nbsp;

As new content, video or gaming platforms emerge, they create ways to financially support their artists. For example, creators, like Grant for the Web media artist [Annie Berman](http://annieberman.net/), Director of&nbsp;[The Faithful](http://www.the-faithful.com), are using the web monetized video platform [Cinnamon](https://interledger.org/case-studies/cinnamon--spicing-up-video-creation-sharing-and-monetizing/) to stage films worldwide, enabling ticket holders to get access to special bonus events and monetize revenue in terms of hours watched. The [Puma Browser](https://interledger.org/case-studies/reimaging-how-we-pay-for-content-and-apps/) is the first browser to natively support the Web Monetization standard, using Interledger.

"To truly enable open payments and web monetization requires interoperability — between data, money and beyond. Open source protocols like Interledger have the potential to change this, doing for money what the internet did for data and making it possible for 1.7 billion unbanked people to more fully participate in the formal global financial system,” said Monica Long, General Manager of RippleX at Ripple, a Founding Member of the Interledger Foundation. “Partnering with the Foundation brings us one step closer to achieving this vision by creating standards for payments that will, in turn, foster opportunities for the budding creator economy to monetize.”&nbsp;

**About Interledger and Web Monetization**<br>Interledger is an open source technology that can send payments across different networks, regardless of currency or platform. Interledger is built based on the same principles of the internet that move small packets of data from one network to another at a very high speed and low cost; instead of moving data, Interledger moves currency. Developed through broad collaboration under the W3C, the [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) feature of the Interledger Protocol is a proposed W3C standard that provides a simple way to transfer very small micropayments across the internet, all the way down to $0.0001, or one ten thousand of one cent.&nbsp;

**About the Interledger Foundation&nbsp;**<br>The Interledger Foundation’s vision is a world where anyone can seamlessly earn, share, buy, sell and trade with anyone else on the web. To achieve its mission of global financial inclusion, the Interledger Foundation operates as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization to maintain and advance Interledger as a public good in service of financial inclusion. Any bank, provider, government office or other entity can freely use Interledger when designing inclusive payment systems. Creators, developers or organizations can apply to the Foundation’s [Grant for the Web program](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/) to fund their Web Monetization initiatives.
