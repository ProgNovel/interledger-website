  <p>The Interledger Foundation community is comprised of a multitude of diverse
  voices, from a wide range of backgrounds. From artists, to programmers, to
  financial inclusion advocates, we are proud to be part of a variety of
  interesting and important projects that impact the lives of millions the world
  over.</p><p>It took the hard work and dedication of many individuals to get us
  this far, and this blog will introduce you to one of the people integral in
  helping us reach this point. Stefan Thomas is the co-creator of the
  Interledger Protocol, the technology behind all the great work and
  accomplishments we&rsquo;re seeing across our community. He is also
  Chairperson of the Interledger Foundation and Founder and CEO of Coil. Read on
  to learn more about his journey in creating the Interledger Protocol and his
  insights on the Foundation&rsquo;s work. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Tell
  us a little about your background and what spurred you to create the
  Interledger Protocol. What problem did you see that you wanted to address?
  </em></strong></p><p>Early in my web development career, I was working as a
  freelancer and kept running into problems with making and receiving payments
  across my group of subcontractors and clients. On the receiving end, I ran
  into issues when clients were late to pay me and my accounts were overdrawn. I
  actually lost my bank account and found myself unbanked for a period, before I
  could find a bank who would give me a second chance. If this could happen to
  me &ndash; someone who would not otherwise be considered underserved or
  underprivileged &ndash; it was easy to imagine how a large portion of the
  world is being negatively impacted by the status quo financial system. On the
  payments end, I often tell a story about a talented designer I worked with who
  was based in Pakistan. One day, the company we used to pay him decided to halt
  services in that country. Other payment options carried much higher fees,
  which meant this designer was no longer competitive and as a result lost out
  on work, all for reasons completely beyond his control.</p><p>That stuck with
  me. In 2010, I stumbled upon Bitcoin and was initially very excited by the
  technology. I started working on it full-time as an unpaid contributor /
  open-source developer and wrote my own Bitcoin implementation called
  BitcoinJS, which is still in use today (although I no longer manage it). In
  2012, I joined &ldquo;OpenCoin,&rdquo; which later became Ripple Labs. At this
  point I started learning more about blockchain in general and began realizing
  that blockchains are difficult to improve because they are so tightly coupled
  &ndash; every change needs to be implemented by a huge number of stakeholders.
  My deep involvement in Bitcoin and Ripple gave me an appreciation for the
  strengths and weaknesses of blockchain, including the difficulty in upgrading
  such systems to keep up with new technologies. This in large part influenced
  the decision NOT to make Interledger a blockchain. Instead, we looked to the
  internet for inspiration on how to create a massive global interoperability
  system that can still remain flexible and evolve as new technologies become
  available. And thus, Interledger was born - a protocol for routing packets of
  money just like the internet routes packets of data. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The
  main problem I saw that I wanted to address is that we have very little
  interoperability in payments. For example, losing your bank account (or not
  having one to begin with) is manageable if your mobile money wallet allows you
  to pay anyone, anywhere. But the reality is that many purchases still require
  a credit card, and you can only get a credit card with a bank account. This is
  where the friction starts to compound. The high cost in payments is also a
  factor of the lack of competition, which again is because of a lack of
  interoperability. Creating a competitor to a major credit card network
  isn&rsquo;t feasible as it would require signing up a huge number of merchants
  around the world. By contrast, I can start my own internet provider with
  relative ease and give my customers access to every website worldwide.
  It&rsquo;s not hard to see why those dynamics have dramatically driven down
  the cost of communication, and we think the same thing is possible for
  payments.</p><p><strong><em>Why is Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s mission of
  financial inclusion important to you? </em></strong></p><p>This ties back to
  the first question. For the millions of people who have information access via
  the internet but lack payment access, it is like looking through a window but
  being unable to touch anything you see. For example, imagine having a business
  idea but being unable to launch it because you lack a bank account. This
  strikes me as an incredibly frustrating situation, especially because hurdles
  like this are fixable; they don&rsquo;t need to exist. As we&rsquo;ve gone
  further on the Interledger Foundation journey, it&rsquo;s become increasingly
  obvious just how broad the Foundation&rsquo;s impact could be and how much
  potential there is to help promote financial inclusion in different
  ways.</p><p><strong><em>How will a universal payments network and web
  monetization build more equitable and creative opportunities for the
  web?</em></strong></p><p>We're living in a world where platforms have become
  very large and powerful, but if we think back a bit to the days of Napster and
  BitTorrent, it looked like protocols were going to win. They showed incredible
  growth and were very popular for a while. And yet, they ultimately failed
  because there was no good way for artists to get paid. Instead, we saw the
  rise of centralized platforms, like Spotify and Netflix, which were able to
  charge fees and sell advertising space. Unfortunately, as these platforms grow
  and consolidate, they become insanely powerful, so there is a growing
  awareness that this simply will not work as a long-term solution. To be clear,
  I believe that platforms play an important role, but there&rsquo;s always a
  need for more than one entity, more than one option for communicating and
  sharing online. It&rsquo;s possible to create some powerful alternatives to
  big platforms with protocols that actually compensate artists, and I believe
  the Interledger Protocol has a significant role to play in making that
  happen.</p><p><strong><em>What excites you most about the Interledger
  Foundation? </em></strong></p><p>First of all, I&rsquo;m very impressed with
  the Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s staff and management. We have a great team
  of people in place who are really driving the Foundation in ways that the
  board could not have imagined. We originally envisioned it as a legal home for
  the Interledger trademark and other intellectual property, but it has already
  become so much more than that. Today, it's a venue for the Interledger
  community to get together, it is administrating the <a
  href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">$100m </a>Grant for the Web program,
  it's been a huge advocate for Interledger tech, and it has taken on an
  ambitious mission around financial inclusion. The Foundation has the
  flexibility to be doing good in the world by tackling problems with an
  Interledger Protocol mindset. If we're successful, Interledger will improve
  the experience people have with the financial system in general &ndash; which
  affects all of us. But it would especially help those who currently experience
  the highest amount of friction and cost, which tragically are the people who
  are least able to afford it. I think that is a worthwhile cause and one I'm
  personally very excited to work towards.</p><p><strong><em>What can the
  Interledger Foundation achieve as an organization moving forward? What do you
  hope the Foundation will achieve?</em></strong></p><p>I think the most
  important thing the Interledger Foundation can do is bring people together and
  play an integral role in building a community of trust, a place where people
  can work together to solve some of our tough financial inclusion
  challenges.</p><p>The Foundation also has a critical role to play in providing
  essential support functions for furthering the live Interledger network, such
  as keeping an official list of Interledger network participants, facilitating
  peering relationships, and hosting standards discussions. We obviously don't
  want the Foundation to become a single point of failure, but when I look at
  the growth of the internet, I think having organizations like IETF and ICANN
  that provide supporting functions has been crucial. I hope and expect to see
  great advancements in these areas as we continue to mature as a
  Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>What other types of
  companies/organizations might benefit from joining the Interledger
  Foundation?</em></strong></p><p>I think there are two broad categories of
  companies who should consider supporting the Foundation. The first group is
  anyone who wants to see the social and structural changes that the Interledger
  Foundation is trying to drive in the areas of payments and financial
  inclusion. The second group is comprised of those who use the Interledger
  Protocol and are dependent on it &ndash; applications that are built on it,
  platforms that are built on it, payment providers who are using it for their
  customers, etc. As the Foundation develops, we may even see two different
  branches start to emerge, one that&rsquo;s more of a charitable organization
  working with the first group, and one that is an industry association focused
  on the second.</p><p><strong><em>Finally, is there anything else you&rsquo;d
  like to add?</em></strong></p><p>I&rsquo;d just like to say that I&rsquo;m so
  grateful to all those in our wider community who are joining us on this
  journey. I've already invested a decade of my life into this project, whose
  success depends almost entirely on the support of others who believe in the
  same vision. Because of that, I'm humbled and thankful for everyone in the
  community who has contributed to the project. A contribution can be as simple
  as mentioning Interledger on social media - every little bit helps. And when I
  look at the grantees and others in the community starting companies and
  projects, I could not be more optimistic and excited about what&rsquo;s
  next.</p><p>To stay up to date on all things Interledger,&nbsp;<a
