  <p>Through the Grant for the Web program, the <a target="_blank"
  rel="noopener" href="https://interledger.org/">Interledger Foundation</a> aims
  to fund innovation supporting openly-networked payments on the web using the
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://interledger.org/developer-tools/get-started/overview/">Interledger
  Protocol</a><a href="https://interledger.org/"> </a>and the <a target="_blank"
  rel="noopener" href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization
  </a>standard. To that end we are excited to announce that our next public<a
  target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://grantfortheweb.org/apply"> Call
  For Proposals</a> is open as of Monday July 26th and will run through
  September 15th at 19:00 UTC.&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal is to help kick-start and
  support a healthy, vibrant ecosystem of web monetized tools, content, and
  resources. We recognize that dominant business models of the web are
  controlled by the same institutions, companies, and algorithms that reinforce
  systemic racism and inequality. We seek to support communities that have
  &ndash; and continue to be &ndash; systemically and deliberately excluded from
  opportunities around financial inclusion and empowerment. Starting in&nbsp;
  2021, we began to mandate that all funded projects have a Diversity, Equity
  and Inclusion (DEI) component, which can manifest itself in one of three&nbsp;
  ways:</p><ul><li>The lead applicant is a person of color or the team
  represents a diverse group of people.&nbsp;</li><li>The output of the team
  benefits communities that have been historically
  underrepresented.</li><li>Funds explicitly earmarked to address increasing
  participation of historically marginalized and underrepresented
  communities.</li></ul><p>This call for proposals focuses on practical activity
  to catalyze Interledger-driven business models for the web that expand
  financial inclusion.<a

  is an open source protocol that connects all types of ledgers to allow simple
  transactions, no matter the location or currency. On the Web, an
  Interledger-powered ecosystem provides opportunities for creators and
  publishers to benefit from new financial models, especially through using the
  open source<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://webmonetization.org/"> Web Monetization
  API</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Applications must fit into one of the following
  categories:</strong></p><p><em>Business Plans for Web Monetized
  Content</em></p><p>Exploring the relationship between specific content types
  and consumer appetites for monetization by offering value propositions that
  are different from traditional web business models.&nbsp; <a target="_blank"

  duration at three funding levels: Spark (up to $15K), Mid-Level (up to $50K),
  and Flagship (up to $100K). All funded projects will need to promote good web
